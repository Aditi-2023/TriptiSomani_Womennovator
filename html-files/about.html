              25% of all Government sourcing had to be done from small
              businesses. This announcement showed the government’s intent to
              encourage small entrepreneurs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprise had been tasked
              to work out the details & they invited her to advise on the policy
              paper. “Why not use the paradigm of quotas to encourage more women
              participation?” She suggested. “Out of the total annual
              procurement from small businesses, 3% percent should come from
              Women owned Enterprises.”
            </p>
            <p>
              3 years later - She got a call from the Ministry confirming that
              her suggestion was incorporated in the new Public Procurement
              Policy. It was an amazing moment - She naively believed that this
              would be the solution to getting loads of orders for women
              entrepreneurs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The data from ‘18 to ‘20 showed that of the total procurement
              target of $591 million from women owned businesses, only $96
              million was achieved, meaning 90% of the target was not achieved!!
            </p>
            <p>
              To narrow this gap, we got many women owned businesses registered
              on the government procurement portals (GEMs). In interactions with
              multi billion dollar government companies such as GAIL and IOCL we
              realised that they want to procure from women but are unable to
              find them. To facilitate this, we started vendor development
              meetings with these companies to help many of them get orders. We
              helped the women negotiate & explained the Quality requirements.
              Proud to say that many of our incubatees are now officially
              supplying to various government agencies.

              25% of all Government sourcing had to be done from small
              businesses. This announcement showed the government’s intent to
              encourage small entrepreneurs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprise had been tasked
              to work out the details & they invited her to advise on the policy
              paper. “Why not use the paradigm of quotas to encourage more women
              participation?” She suggested. “Out of the total annual
              procurement from small businesses, 3% percent should come from
              Women owned Enterprises.”
            </p>
            <p>
              3 years later - She got a call from the Ministry confirming that
              my suggestion was incorporated in the new Public Procurement
              Policy. It was an amazing moment - She naively believed that this
              would be the solution to getting loads of orders for women
              entrepreneurs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The data from ‘18 to ‘20 showed that of the total procurement
              target of $591 million from women owned businesses, only $96
              million was achieved, meaning 90% of the target was not achieved!!
            </p>
            <p>
              To narrow this gap, we got many women owned businesses registered
              on the government procurement portals (GEMs). In interactions with
              multi billion dollar government companies such as GAIL and IOCL we
              realised that they want to procure from women but are unable to
              find them. To facilitate this, we started vendor development
              meetings with these companies to help many of them get orders. We
              helped the women negotiate & explained the Quality requirements.
              Proud to say that many of our incubatees are now officially
              supplying to various government agencies.
