                    <p>Everyone knows me by the myriad of roles I play- a Daughter, Wife, Mother, CEO and so on…</p>

                    <p>But, I like to call myself a ‘Success Coach’ as that pretty much sums up all my roles, my goals and my aspirations. That is what I thrive on.. That is what I strive for the most- Success! This Success is not for me alone, but for all those people that I work, support and associate with. Be it my family, my company or several other initiatives that I work on. I naturally succeed when all these people succeed and this is the real me. Me, behind all the tags and the glorious positions I proudly hold.</p>

                    <p>A Chartered Accountant and Post graduate in law with over 16 years of progressive experience in profit and non-profit organizations both large and SMEs including business and financial advisory for various organizations such as PwC, Grant Thornton (GT) &amp; World Bank. Very early on in my career I got exposed to various multi – national, foreign and domestic companies spread over a range of industries and have been involved in several cross border transactions, both outbound and inbound, on behalf of strategic and financial investors.</p>

                    <p>A natural Networker, I believe- ‘Success knows no shortcuts’ and I am passionate about coaching the young Entrepreneurs on their journey. If you are an aspirational Entrepreneur and want to utilize the needed support join our incubation &amp; acceleration Programs available for you @ KGS Advisors. I coach Entrepreneurs @ SMEs, MSMEs &amp; Women run businesses wherein I empower these Entrepreneurs with a strong eco-system integrated with Finance, Strategy, Governance, Market Validation and even Fund Raising Assistance.</p>

                    <p>A popular TEDxSpeaker, a writer, I contribute to reputed industry events and influence the policymakers to bring about a change in the govt. policies to support the young Entrepreneurs. Please feel free to reach out to me and until then the one message I have for you is – ‘Dream the impossible, see the unknown &amp; achieve greatness’.

                    <p>25% of all Government sourcing had to be done from small businesses. This announcement showed the government’s intent to encourage small entrepreneurs. </p> 
                    <p>The Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprise had been tasked to work out the details & they  invited me to advise on the policy paper.  “Why not use the paradigm of quotas to encourage more women participation?” I suggested.  “Out of the total annual procurement from small businesses, 3% percent should come from Women owned Enterprises.” </p> 
                    <p>3 years later - I got a call from the Ministry confirming that my suggestion was incorporated in the new Public Procurement Policy. It was an amazing moment - I naively believed that this would be the solution to getting loads of orders for women entrepreneurs.</p> 
                    <p>The data from ‘18 to ‘20 showed that of the total procurement target of $591 million from women owned businesses,  only $96 million was achieved, meaning 90% of the target was not achieved!! </p> 
                    <p>To narrow this gap, we got many women owned businesses registered on the government procurement portals (GEMs). In interactions with  multi billion dollar government companies such as GAIL and IOCL we realised that they want to procure from women but are unable to find them.  To facilitate this, we started vendor development meetings with these  companies to help many of them get orders. We helped the women negotiate & explained the Quality requirements. Proud to say that many of our incubatees are now officially supplying to various government agencies.
